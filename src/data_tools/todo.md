Documentation tightening (no code changes made)
- fd_api.py: Docstrings (e.g., get_price_snapshot/get_equity_snapshot) reiterate assumptions and obvious steps; could be condensed to essential behavior/risks and avoid restating parameter types. Inline comments narrate straightforward operations (e.g., “Get historical prices”, “Calculate returns”) and can be pruned where the code is self-evident. Return-structure descriptions in docstrings are redundant now that Pydantic models document fields.
- qa_builder.py: Function docstrings are verbose and repeat usage notes (e.g., generate_from_pdf handling HTML) across helpers; consider a short module-level note instead. Inline comments in the dataset-flattening loops restate code (e.g., “Dataset is a tuple...”) and could be removed or replaced with a single brief helper docstring. Error-path notes in extract_mda_section/extract_full_10k could be shortened to a sentence about returning None on parser errors.
- schemas.py: Docstrings are already brief; no changes recommended.

Silent failures / overly complex logic (no code changes made)
- fd_api.py: get_company_facts returns defaults (“Unknown”/0) when non-200 responses occur, so auth/404/server errors look like valid data. get_price_snapshot labels results with the requested date even if the latest trading date differs, and defaults missing returns to 1.0 when data is incomplete—both can mask gaps.
- qa_builder.py: extract_mda_section/extract_full_10k swallow all exceptions, print, and return None, hiding real parser/network/auth issues. Dataset-flattening loops are duplicated across generators and silently drop unexpected item shapes, returning empty lists without signaling upstream library changes or errors.
