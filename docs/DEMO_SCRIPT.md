# Demo Script (Week 7)

1. Open with problem: booking/pricing errors, manual validation pain, audit pressure.
2. Show architecture (FastAPI → Desk orchestrator → agents).
3. Run `GET /health` to prove readiness.
4. Run `POST /run-desk-agent` with a clean scenario → highlight summary/narrative.
5. Run with mis-booked/pricing-issue scenario → show flags, explanations.
6. Emphasize value: faster checks, fewer errors, audit-friendly outputs, extensibility.
7. Q&A: latency targets, configuration, integration options.
